  <h2>COLLADA-to-glTF Converter Microservice</h2>
  <p>The COLLADA-to-glTF Converter Microservice uses the same structure as the <a
      href="https://github.com/stelemme/template-microservice-js">Express
      template</a>. Two folders are added to the root of the Microservice. The first folder is the base-files directory
    which temporarily houses the COLLADA and glTF-file
    during conversion. After the conversion is done, all files are deleted from this folder. The second folder is the
    cli folder. CLI stands for Command Line Interface. The COLLADE-to-glTF
    conversion happens by using the COLLADA2GLTF application provided by the KhronosGroup. This application can be found
    in the cli folder. In the colladaToGltf.js file, two controller
    functions are present which handle the GET and POST response of the following endpoint.</p>
  <p><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="redirectIfctoLbd();">
      <script>document.write(window.location.href)</script>conv/collada-to-gltf
    </a></p>
  <p>The GET response of the endpoint returns a JSON object that specifies which methods and data types are supported by
    the endpoint. This endpoint must receive a COLLADA-file. The POST response then returns the converted glTF-file if
    the request is correctly sent in the body of the request. The process can be tested using Postman
    or a Controller Microservice.</p>
